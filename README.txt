Hey this is Sanskar
This is my bubble shppter game i created for the cs 101 project
As basic controls for this game I have included various different movements
THE MANDATORY ONES:
1)W-shoot
2)A-left
3)D-right //these were the ones already present in the starter code

Now for the ADDITIONAL FEATURES
1)up arrow-shoot
2)right arrow-rotates the gun to the right
3)left arrow-rotates the gun to the left
4)i have added a health bar with 2 health as the game is quite  easy
  so of you lose the console displays you lose
5)i have added  a Play Again feature which works after the game ends i.e. after you win or lose
6)i have added 3 levels which you have to reach by clearing the previous ones
7)Also the game has a score counter
8)The bubble color changes as the levels proceed
